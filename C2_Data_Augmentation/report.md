# Task 2: Data Augmentation and Balancing (C2)

### Objective
To balance the dataset by generating synthetic samples using image augmentation.

### What I Learned
- How to perform random image transformations using Pillow.
- Balancing dataset classes by duplication and variation.
- Creating reports for dataset distribution before and after augmentation.

### Challenges
- Maintaining image quality while augmenting.
- Preventing overfitting due to excessive similar augmentations.
